    "text": "I am a DPhil (PhD) candidate in politics at the University of Oxford’s Department of Politics and International Relations. My work, supervised by Dr Katerina Tertytchnaya, focuses on politics in Central Asia.\nMy doctoral work examines local governance, bureaucracy, and elite politics in authoritarian contexts. I use computational techniques to create and code new, detailed, and large datasets on elites’ and bureaucrats’ careers in Kazakhstan. With this data, I present evidence on just how elites come to hold power, how they use it, and how their actions shape their political futures. This work is funded by a four-year Economic and Social Research Council (UK government) studentship awarded by the Grand Union Doctoral Training Programme."

    "text": "Current projects\nIn some of my doctoral research, I study how mid-ranking bureaucrats strategically use appointment powers to overcome delegation problems and build patronal ‘teams’ of loyal subordinates. Focusing on district bureaucrats in Kazakhstan, I collect an original, large dataset of bureaucrats and their appointees, as well as a large corpus of bureaucrats’ biographies. I use the data to demonstrate biased hiring within local government structures. I use information on 1.2 million public procurement contracts to show that biased hiring is connected with service delivery and that good service delivery conditions negative central government responses to personalistic appointments. A second paper examines subnational delegation. Who do national elites share power with? How do they judge their subordinates’ abilities? I collect biographic data on regional governors to show how Kazakhstan’s regime has manipulated their careers to build loyalty to the centre. Finally, with Kirill Melnikov and Eleonora Minaeva at the European University Institute, I am working on a project examining the impact of introducing local elections on the make-up of Kazakhstan’s local elites.\nI am currently a research assistant on Dr Katerina Tertytchnaya’s ESRC funded project on non-violent repression. Previously, I worked as a research assistant on the UKRI/Horizon Europe-funded AUTHLIB project, Professor Lenka Buštíková’s work on illiberalism in Ukraine, and the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment."

    "text": "Abstract: Are bureaucratic managers strategic when hiring? Do appointment practices affect service delivery and shape managers’ career progression? A growing literature considers the behavior of bureaucratic managers, predominantly drawing on evidence from electoral democracies. It is not yet clear whether these findings extend to authoritarian settings, where the threat of political punishment is greater and managers’ incentives differ. I present new theory on the behavior of bureaucratic managers in authoritarian settings and use novel data from Kazakhstan to test whether their behavior influences economic outcomes and career progression. I construct time-series data on over 15,000 appointments by district managers and use new measures of bureaucratic effectiveness based on public procurement. My findings suggest that managers use appointment powers to strategically build `teams’ of personally loyal subordinates who—based on interpersonal ties—they trust to follow orders. I show that appointments shape service delivery, with appointees signing more contracts of higher value. Finally, the evidence suggests that managers engaging in excessive appointments are more likely to be dismissed and that service delivery moderates the relationship between appointments and dismissals. The paper provides new evidence on bureaucracies outside of democracies, on subnational officials’ behaviour, and state solutions to bureaucratic control.\n\n\nPresented at PolEcon Almaty 2025\nPresented at the APSG’s 2025 Summer Conference on Authoritarian Politics\n\n\n\n\nWorking paper PDF [last update: 25 March 2025]\n\nAbstract: Why do autocrats ‘shuffle’ elites around positions? Existing work suggests this practice aims to boost performance, with underperforming officials more frequently rotated. Yet I show that in Kazakhstan there is no association between performance and rotation. Instead, I explain shuffling as a strategy of co-optation. Shuffling prevents some of the potential downsides of co-opting elites through state office by disrupting network formation and freeing up positions for junior cadre. At the same time, it keeps co-optation credible by reassuring most elites of their long-term seniority. To test this argument, I present a detailed biographic dataset of regional governors (akims) in Kazakhstan between 1997 and 2022. Consistent with my argument, elites holding these posts are frequently shuffled to and from other senior positions. By contrast, there is a robust lack of association between regional socioeconomic measures and when a governor is rotated or dismissed. Sometimes, shuffling aims more at enhancing elites’ loyalty than their performance.\n\n\nPresented at MPSA 2025\n\n\n\n\nWith Kirill Melnikov and Eleonora Minaeva\n\nAbstract: This study examines the introduction of local executive elections in Kazakhstan, where rural executives (akims) were previously appointed through a centralized system. We analyze the impact of these elections on elite turnover and recruitment, leveraging a complete dataset of all subdistrict elections and a pilot study of akim biographies. Elections resulted in frequent leadership replacement. Nevertheless, we show that they did not result in inclusion of a broader group of local or the selection of more locally-embedded officials. The results suggest that elections may serve more to formalize the renewal of the same bureaucratic elite than to co-opt new groups or widen access to power.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Which merits do autocrats care about when selecting officials? In some contexts, regimes prioritise economic competence and promote based on growth or unemployment figures. In other cases, political stability is more important. Officials are incentivised to improve turnout and the proregime vote. These effects may be conditional or—in many cases—performance may simply not matter for appointments. Work on autocratic meritocracy, nonetheless, should consider wider operationalisation of political merit, provide stronger evidence of merit not mattering, and study cases beyond China and Russia. I advance the literature using newly collected evidence on governors’ career trajectories in Kazakhstan paired with economic, electoral, and protest data. I use an equivalence testing approach to provide strong evidence that economic merit—even exceptionally good performance—does not matter in this case, while good political performance can somewhat increase a governors’ prospects of promotion. I contribute to work on promotion tournaments and performance incentives under autocracy, while presenting new data from an important but understudied case of hegemonic electoral autocracy.\n\n\nPresented at EPSA 2025"
